# Hike-U

Being avid hikers, we have created a comprehensive application for hike planning - Hike-U. It allows the user to plan their hike details including the route, dates and planned stops. While mapping out the trail, the app displays weather information, which can be useful for picking dates and equipment. User can create a list of all of their hiking equipment and use that list to create specific packing lists for every hike. After the hike, the user can create a journal entry where they can upload photos and record their memories of the trails.

## Features

* __Personalised account__: Users will have to create an account and log in to create and see their content. 
* __Mapping the route__: Users can type is start and end locations for the hike, which will be displayed on the map. They can manually drag the route to adjust it, as desired/needed. After picking the locations, the weather application will display the six day forecast, which can assist the user with planning.
* __Detailed hike planning__: The app will let the user select the hike dates and include a title and a description of the planned hike. Furthermore, they can plan multiple stops on the way and save those in a separate list. 
* __Equipment planning__: Users can add the hiking equipment they own to a separate page. They can assign different categories to each item, which will allow the user to filter their equipment based on specific needs (e.g. overnight, rainy day). When planning a hike, users can add individual items from the overall list to create a packing list.
* __Record the memories__: After the hike, the users can create a journal entry to record their experiences and memories. Besides the hike title and dates, the users can also record the difficulty of the trail as well as upload photos and describe their hike with as much detail as desired. These posts will be archived and the users can revisit their experiences. The page also includes a search function to aide with finding the entries.
